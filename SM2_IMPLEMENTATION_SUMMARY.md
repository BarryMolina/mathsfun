# SM-2 Spaced Repetition Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented the SM-2 (SuperMemo-2) spaced repetition algorithm for addition fact mastery tracking in MathsFun, replacing the previous discrete mastery level system with adaptive, science-based learning intervals.

## Implementation Completed

### âœ… Phase 1: Database Schema
- **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20250730120001_add_sm2_spaced_repetition.sql`
- **Changes**:
  - Renamed `addition_fact_performances` â†’ `math_fact_performances`
  - Added SM-2 columns: `repetition_number`, `easiness_factor`, `interval_days`, `next_review_date`
  - Created new `math_fact_attempts` table for time series data
  - Updated indexes and constraints

### âœ… Phase 2: Domain Models
- **MathFactPerformance**: `src/domain/models/math_fact_performance.py`
  - Implements complete SM-2 algorithm
  - Grade calculation from response time and error count
  - Automatic interval scheduling with timezone awareness
  - Ease factor bounds (1.3 - 4.0)
- **MathFactAttempt**: `src/domain/models/math_fact_attempt.py`
  - Time series tracking of individual attempts
  - Includes SM-2 grade and session error count

### âœ… Phase 3: SM-2 Algorithm
- **Grade Calculation** (0-5 scale):
  - 5: Perfect recall (< 2000ms, no errors)
  - 4: Good recall (2000-3000ms, no errors)
  - 3: Satisfactory recall (>= 3000ms, no errors)
  - 2: Easy after error (< 3000ms, 1 error)
  - 1: Slow after error (>= 3000ms, 1 error)
  - 0: Blackout (2+ errors)
- **Interval Progression**: 1 day â†’ 6 days â†’ EF-based exponential growth
- **Ease Factor Updates**: Dynamic adjustment based on performance quality

### âœ… Phase 4: Service Layer
- **MathFactService**: `src/domain/services/math_fact_service.py`
  - Replaces AdditionFactService with SM-2 functionality
  - `track_attempt()` with atomic updates
  - `get_facts_due_for_review()` with scheduling
  - `analyze_session_performance()` with comprehensive analytics
- **Repository Pattern**: `src/infrastructure/database/repositories/math_fact_repository.py`
  - Atomic transactions for concurrent updates
  - Batch processing capabilities
  - Due fact queries with timezone handling

### âœ… Phase 5: Controller Updates
- **Session Tracking Format**: `(operand1, operand2, final_correct, final_response_time_ms, incorrect_attempts_count)`
- **Addition Controller**: Updated to use MathFactService
- **Addition Tables Controller**: Major enhancement with submenu system

### âœ… Phase 6: UI Features
- **Review Due Facts**: New feature for practicing scheduled facts
- **Dynamic Menu**: Shows count of facts due for review
- **SM-2 Insights**: Performance analytics and review scheduling info
- **Progress Tracking**: Enhanced results display with spaced repetition metrics

### âœ… Phase 7: Comprehensive Testing
- **Model Tests**: Complete test coverage for SM-2 algorithm
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Automation Scripts**: Comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate
- **Type Safety**: Full mypy compliance
- **Code Quality**: Black formatting and clean architecture

## Key Features Implemented

- Comprehensive progress feedback
- Motivational performance insights

### âš¡ Technical Excellence
- Atomic database transactions prevent data corruption
- Timezone-aware scheduling
- Clean separation of concerns with dependency injection
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Breaking Changes

- **Database Schema**: Complete migration required (no backward compatibility)
- **Session Format**: Updated tracking format for error count inclusion
- **Service Interface**: MathFactService replaces AdditionFactService
- **UI Flow**: Addition tables now uses submenu system

## Verification Status

All implementation phases completed and verified:
- âœ… Database Migration (valid SQL, all required columns)
- âœ… Core Models (SM-2 algorithm correctness)
- âœ… Type Checking (mypy compliance)
- âœ… Code Formatting (black compliance)
- âœ… Unit Tests (model functionality)
- âœ… Import System (all dependencies resolved)
- âœ… Controller Updates (UI integration)
- âœ… Dependency Injection (service wiring)

**Test Suite Result: 8/8 tests passed (100%)**
