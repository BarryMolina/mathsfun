This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MathsFun is a Python CLI application for interactive math practice, focusing on addition problems with configurable difficulty levels. The application uses a clean, layered architecture with dependency injection, Supabase integration for data persistence, and comprehensive testing.

## Development Guidelines

- Always use descriptive filenames. Avoid generic names for shared modules like "common" or "utils"
- When asked to present your plan, always pick the most simple, intuitive solution and avoid all unnecessary complexity
