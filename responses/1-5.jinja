1. List all difficulty levels within the given range, writing out the corresponding range of numbers for each level:
   - Difficulty Level 1: Two single-digit numbers (each number ranges from 0 to 9).
   - Difficulty Level 2: Two two-digit numbers (each number ranges from 10 to 99), with no carrying required (the ones digits of the two numbers must add up to 9 or less, and the tens digits must also add up to 9 or less to ensure no carrying in any column).
   - Difficulty Level 3: Two two-digit numbers (each number ranges from 10 to 99), with carrying required (the ones digits of the two numbers must add up to more than 9).
   - Difficulty Level 4: Two three-digit numbers (each number ranges from 100 to 999), with no carrying required (the ones digits, tens digits, and hundreds digits of the two numbers must each add up to 9 or less in their respective columns).
   - Difficulty Level 5: Two three-digit numbers (each number ranges from 100 to 999), with carrying required (at least one column, specifically the ones digits, must add up to more than 9 to ensure carrying occurs).

2. Calculate how many problems should be generated for each difficulty level, aiming for an even distribution:
   - Total problems to generate: 10 (from NUM_PROBLEMS).
   - Number of difficulty levels in the range: 5 (from LOW_DIFFICULTY 1 to HIGH_DIFFICULTY 5).
   - Even distribution: Divide the total problems by the number of levels: 10 ÷ 5 = 2 problems per level.
   - Therefore, each difficulty level (1 through 5) will have exactly 2 problems.

3. Create a distribution plan for the problems:
   - Difficulty Level 1: 2 problems
   - Difficulty Level 2: 2 problems
   - Difficulty Level 3: 2 problems
   - Difficulty Level 4: 2 problems
   - Difficulty Level 5: 2 problems
   - Total: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 problems
   - This plan ensures an even distribution across the specified range, adhering to the rules for each level.

<problem_solving>
Based on the distribution plan, I will generate 2 problems for each difficulty level from 1 to 5. For each problem, I will:
1. Generate the appropriate numbers based on the difficulty level.
2. Create the addition problem.
3. Calculate the answer and show the work.
